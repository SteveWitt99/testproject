        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>Background</u><br>
        </b><br>Ideas about marriage have shifted and changed dramatically throughout human history, and such change continues even today. At different points marriage has been defined in response to economic realities, by the primacy of procreation and by societal understandings of the role of men and women. In the Gospel we find ground for a definition of marriage and family relationships based on affirmation of the full humanity of each partner, lived out in mutual care and respect for one another. Scripture itself, along with the global human experience, offers many different views of family and how family is to be defined. This unfolding revelation and understanding needs to be weighed carefully by people of faith considering the issue of equal marriage rights for couples regardless of gender. Jesus radically challenged his traditional cultural roles and concepts of family life. Jesus boldly declares members of the household/family of God to be whoever hears and follows the will of God.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Civil/legal marriage carries with it significant access to institutional support, rights and benefits. There are more than 1,400 such rights and benefits in the federal statutes alone. Efforts to ban civil marriage to couples regardless of gender denies them and their children access to these rights and benefits, and thus, undermines the civil liberties of gay and lesbian couples, putting them and their children at risk.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout its history, the United Church of Christ has been at the forefront in the struggle for justice and equality. For more than 30 years, the General Synod of the UCC has adopted resolutions affirming lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons, consistently calling for an end to discrimination, equal protection under the law, deploring LGBT hate crimes and violence, supporting LGBT relationships and families, celebrating the gifts of LGBT persons for ministry and encouraging all settings of the church to be open and affirming of LGBT persons, welcoming them and encouraging their participation in every aspect of the mission and ministry of the church.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Theological and Ethical Foundations</u><br>
        <br>
        </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The message of the Gospel is the lens through which the whole of scripture is to be interpreted. Love and compassion, justice and peace are at the very core of the life and ministry of Jesus. It is a message that always bends toward inclusion. The biblical story recounts the ways in which inclusion and welcome to God&#146;s community is ever-expanding &#151; from the story of Abraham and Sarah, to the inclusive ministry of Jesus, to the missionary journeys of Paul throughout the Greco-Roman world. Jesus&#146; ministry was to address the situations and structures of exclusion, injustice and oppression that diminish God&#146;s people and keep them from realizing the full gift of personhood. The scriptures affirm and celebrate human expressions of love and partnership.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The language of covenant is central to the message of scripture concerning relationships and community. Both in the message of the prophets and the teachings of Jesus covenant relationships are important. They are taken seriously by God and to be taken seriously by God&#146;s people. While Jesus said little about the institution of marriage, he did speak about covenant relationships and criticized those who took the marriage covenant frivolously (Mark 10:2-12). The overriding message of the Gospel is that God calls God&#146;s people to live fully the gift of love in responsible, faithful, just, committed, covenantal relationships of trust that recognize and respect the image of God in all people. These Gospel values are at the core of the covenantal relationship that we call marriage. God is the creator of all people, including people of differing sexual orientations, and has bestowed on each one the gift of human sexuality. Therefore the logically and ethically, there is neither justification for denying couples regardless of gender the blessing of the church in marriage nor for denying them equal protection under the law by refusing to grant a civil marriage license recognized and respected by all civil entities.</font></p>
