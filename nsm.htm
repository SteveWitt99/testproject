<p align='center'>Interfaith Service, New Sanctuary Movement, August 28, 2007</p>
<p>The United Church of Christ in Simi Valley has lived since its inception on January 1, 1995 by its principles and core values. Two in particular inform our willingness to be a sanctuary congregation as part of the New Sanctuary Movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our church is challenged and inspired by the life and teachings of Jesus.
<li>Our church affirms basic human rights, and encourages involvement on behalf of those whose rights are threatened.
</ul>
<p>As a member of the Board of Ventura County Clue (Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice) I learned in June of Liliana’s plight. I also knew that no other church in Ventura County had been able to step forward and offer itself as a sanctuary congregation.</p>
<p>Our particular discernment process began in May when two parishioners joined me in attending an orientation for the New Sanctuary Movement. When I later learned of Liliana’s circumstances, I invited Alice Linsmeier, the Executive Director of VC Clue to meet with our Church Council. These nine members are the principle guiding body for the church, with the exception of specially called Congregational meetings.</p>
<p>After hearing and discussing in full Liliana’s situation, Council voted to present the possibility of becoming part of this movement to a Congregational meeting set for June 17th. After the June 17th meeting, the congregation voted to request a proposal from VC CLUE to become a sanctuary congregation to be considered at a second congregational meeting. On July 8th after prayerful discussion and reflection, the United Church of Christ in Simi Valley voted overwhelmingly to go forward with Council’s direction and begin the process that has made today’s service possible.</p>
<p>We have been inspired by Liliana’s story to take the peaceful action of offering her and her son Pablito prophetic hospitality. It is our hope that our peaceful actions in response to the current immigration crisis effecting over 12 million undocumented workers in this country will encourage thoughtful debate and in the very near future a comprehensive restructuring of US immigration policy. We believe that family re-unification should be a primary tenet of immigration policy, even as our government moves to protect our borders and all citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, we feel honored and privileged that God has called us to this ministry of prophetic hospitality and we will do everything in our power as a community of faith to make Liliana’s stay with us a blessing to her and her family.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. June C. Goudey, Pastor United Church of Christ in Simi Valley, CA</p>
